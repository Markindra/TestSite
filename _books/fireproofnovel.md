Inside burning buildings, Captain Caleb Holt lives by the firefighter’s adage: Never leave your partner. Yet at home, in the cooling embers of his marriage, countless arguments has him wanting to leave. As they prepare for divorce, Caleb’s father challenges him to commit to a 40-day experiment: “The Love Dare.” Wondering if it’s even worth the effort, Caleb reluctantly agrees, not realizing it will change his life.

Surprised by what he discovers about the meaning of love, Caleb begins to see his wife and marriage as worth fighting for. But is it too late? His job is to rescue others. Now Captain Holt must face his toughest job ever . . . rescuing his wife’s heart.
