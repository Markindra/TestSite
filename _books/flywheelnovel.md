Jay Austin did what it took to get ahead and make the quick sell at work. But the more successful he was, the more he traded what really mattered. His integrity. It wasn’t until God unraveled everything that he saw how empty his life had become. Now it will take a courageous heart and a saving grace for Jay to turn his drive into a desire for a more authentic life with God as well as with his wife and son.

In a world filled with cheap imitations that distract us from God’s higher plans, Flywheel is a powerful parable for all who hunger to live an authentic life.
