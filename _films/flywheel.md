FLYWHEEL is the first feature written, directed, and produced by Alex and Stephen Kendrick. Though it was shot on a shoestring budget, FLYWHEEL has become the biggest "fan-favorite of the four" and garners one of the strongest storylines and movie twists. This heartwarming drama tells the story of a crooked used car salesman who gets his classic car and his life completely "remodeled."
