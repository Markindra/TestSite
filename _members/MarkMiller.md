Mark and his family have chosen to live intentionally for the Glory of God wherever they may reside and joined the Kendrick Brothersâ€™ team in September 2019 after 15 years overseas. He has a background in audio engineering and non-fiction video production but has expanded that skill set to include graphic design, web development, video production, and has recently taken a dive into user experience design. He has even sold cowboy hats in India! He has a particular interest in history and telling non-fiction stories that move viewers to think critically.

Mark is married to Heather and lives in Albany, Georgia with their four boys.
