It is with hearts of gratefulness for the past and a sense of God's leadership for the future that the Kendrick brothers have announced a new direction. After years of prayer, and with the support and blessing of their pastor, Alex and Stephen have expanded their movie making endeavors beyond Sherwood Baptist Church's walls.

![Stephen and Alex Kendrick head a new direction - Sherwood Pictures](https://kendrickbrothers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Stephen-and-Alex-Kendrick-New-Direction-Sherwood-Pictures.jpg)Kendrick Brothers Productions has launched an independent movie production company designed to partner with believers across the nation and help train the next generation of Christian filmmakers. The Kendrick brothers plan to make their next movie under this new paradigm.

The Kendricks said, “God has been clearly speaking to us through His Word, in prayer, and through the counsel of our pastor and other Godly men. This decision has come out of a faith-step of obedience to God’s leading. We dearly love our pastor, Michael Catt, our executive pastor Jim McBride, and our church family. They have believed in us, prayed for us, and sacrificially supported us every step of the way. We see the wisdom of the Lord’s timing in all of this."

Pastor Catt said, “Jim and I are blessed to call Alex and Stephen our friends and co-laborers for the Gospel. They will continue to live in Albany and be an active part of the ministry of Sherwood Baptist Church. We love these guys and are grateful for God sending them to our staff over a decade ago. It will be exciting for us to take the steps of faith required to see where God will take us. No matter what lies ahead, this has been an incredible ride for all of us. Our prayers are with them as they pursue future endeavors.”
