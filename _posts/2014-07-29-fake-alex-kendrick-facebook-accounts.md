Quite frequently I receive notice that an imposter has created a Facebook account in my name and with my likeness. The imposter typically posts Bible verses or some seemingly-spiritual comments on the “Alex Kendrick” accounts and then lures “friends” to donate money to an orphanage, ministry, etc. that I supposedly support. Some of my own fellow church members have fallen victim to the scheme.

_**Please do not be fooled into “friending” the imposters, and never send money to the “charities” endorsed on these fake accounts.**_

Each time that I’m made aware of the imposter accounts I report them to Facebook. Our [Kendrick Brothers](https://www.facebook.com/kendrickbrothers) Facebook page is a [“Verified” account](https://www.facebook.com/help/196050490547892), and I encourage you to follow our latest movie news there.
