Thank you for your prayers and words of encouragement. We are inspired and excited as we continue with the script writing and research for the next movie. God continues to confirm and bless the direction. This Spring we will be casting actors, selecting our crew, and scheduling the details of the production. Currently, we have received over 500 actor applications through our website and almost 200 for positions on the crew. Please pray that God will grant us wisdom and clear direction as we make crucial story and production decisions.  
  
God continues to show us His needed favor as we move forward. We recognize that we are totally dependent on Him. Will you join us in praying for His blessing, favor, power, and protection on all aspects of this project? Our prayer is that this movie will transform countless lives, strengthen the body of Christ, and impact the nations for His glory.
