_A Personal Message from Alex, Stephen and Shannon Kendrick_

  


#### **Movie 6 is in the works! Pray!**

After months of prayer, we believe the Lord has given us clear direction concerning the plot for our next movie. Even as [COURAGEOUS](http://courageousthemovie.com/) highlighted fatherhood and [WAR ROOM](https://warroomthemovie.com/) focused on prayer, this next movie will unpack another pivotal issue in the life of students and adults alike. We have been inspired with the storyline and are excited to begin the next phases of production and all that follows.

![Kendrick Brothers Praying On Set War Room](https://kendrickbrothers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Kendrick-Brothers-Praying-On-Set-War-Room-300x169.jpg)Please pray for us as we complete the script and pre-production and hopefully shoot later this year. Then, as the Lord leads us, we hope to release the movie in the fall of 2019. As we continue to develop the story, we are asking for prayer. The script has to be solid and on target. The Lord has graciously carried us in the past and we recognize our desperate need for His guidance and grace now.   
  
Pray for His inspiration, creativity, and discernment as we develop the characters and craft the scenes. Pray for His blessing, favor, protection, and power to be on this project from beginning to end. And ask Him to strategically use this movie to transform countless lives, restore broken families, and greatly impact the nations for His glory. To God be the glory! Thank you in advance!
