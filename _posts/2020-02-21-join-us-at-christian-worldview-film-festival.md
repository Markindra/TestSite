![](https://kendrickbrothers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CWFF2020-300x300.jpg)Since the early days of their filmmaking journey, the Kendrick Brothers have had a desire to pour into other Christian filmmakers. One way we do this is by connecting with other filmmakers annually at the Christian Worldview Film Festival. CWFF is a great way for Christian filmmakers to learn, grow in their faith and skills, feature their work and network with others.

The Christian Worldview Film Festival & Filmmakers Guild is an annual 6-day conference focused on equipping and encouraging filmmakers and film enthusiasts from a Biblical worldview. The week consists of 3 days of training and networking during the Filmmakers Guild and 3 days of screening over 50 films at the Film Festival. The Christian Worldview Film Festival exists to facilitate community, learning, and encouragement among filmmakers seeking to glorify God in their craft. This year’s CWFF is March 16-20 at City of the City in Franklin, Tennessee. All three Kendrick brothers will be there for the week to lead, learn, listen and interact with other filmmakers.

Christian Worldview Film Festival is family-friendly and Nashville is close by so it’s a great place to visit.

We’ll see you in Franklin next month!
