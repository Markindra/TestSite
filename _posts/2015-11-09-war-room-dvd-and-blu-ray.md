_Don’t Miss the Film that Inspired Audiences and Became the #1 Movie in America_

CBA Exclusive Editions Available on Blu-ray™/DVD Combo Pack and DVD Dec. 22

Church Site Licenses Available for Pre-Sale November 9

_NASHVILLE, TN (Nov. 9, 2015)_ – The heartwarming and inspirational box office hit WAR ROOM debuts Dec. 22 in the Christian bookstore market on Blu-ray™ and DVD from Provident Films and Provident Distribution.  Church site licenses are available for pre-purchase on Nov. 9 and will begin shipping on Dec. 8. The products available will be the CBA Collector’s Edition DVD and the CBA Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack which both include special content only available in Christian Bookstores.

  
Packed with special features, the WAR ROOM Blu-ray and Collector's Edition DVD include hilarious bloopers & outtakes, the “Warrior” music video by Steven Curtis Chapman, and “The Art of Jumping Rope” featurette where viewers get to meet Coach Stephen Simpson and hear how he trained the actors to double Dutch in two weeks. Blu-ray™ and DVD bonus materials also include Deleted Scenes, Commentary from the Kendrick brothers, plus eight Behind-the-Scenes featurettes that are, in many ways, as inspirational as the film. These include “The Making of WAR ROOM,” which dives deeper into the unique production, “The Heart of WAR ROOM,” that focuses on its powerful message and meaning; and “Modern Day Miss Clara,” which introduces viewers to Molly Bruno, a 91-year-old prayer warrior and one of the inspirations behind the character of Miss Clara. Also included are “From Auditioning to Acting”, an insider’s look at the casting and “Investing in the Next Generation,” which shows how the Kendricks’ mentored aspiring filmmakers on set.  
  


“A Pastor’s Call to Prayer,” features spiritual leaders like Dr. Tony Evans and Pastor Ronnie Floyd sharing the importance of church leaders guiding their congregations to the centrality of prayer. The faith community will love “Church on Its Knees,” which reveals how church families can set up their own prayer ministry; and “WAR ROOM in 60 Seconds,” a fast and funny retelling of the plot of WAR ROOM with a twist.  Both the WAR ROOM feature film, and the new Behind the Scenes bonus featurettes promise audiences a journey of laughter and tears to enjoy together this coming Christmas.  
  


Features exclusive to the products offered to the Christian bookstore market include a devotion by Alex Kendrick, a devotion by Stephen Kendrick, a “Wall of Remembrance” featurette and a special behind-the-scenes feature about the home used during filming titled “Redemption For the Mitchell Home”.  
  


The faith and family drama that became the #1 movie in US theaters focuses on the transformative power of prayer.  The film centers on a seemingly perfect family who find desperately needed help for their hidden problems from a wise, elderly widow named Miss Clara.  Directed by Alex Kendrick, produced by Stephen Kendrick, and written by Alex Kendrick and Stephen Kendrick, WAR ROOM stars best-selling author Priscilla C. Shirer (New York Times best-selling author and Bible teacher), T.C. Stallings (Courageous), Karen Abercrombie (Rose from the Dead) and Beth Moore (New York Times best-selling author and Bible teacher) with Alex Kendrick (Courageous) and comedian Michael Jr. (The Clean Stand Up Comedy Tour). 

  
_Synopsis:_

Tony and Elizabeth Jordan have it all—great jobs, a beautiful daughter, and their dream house. But appearances can be deceiving. Tony and Elizabeth Jordan’s world is actually crumbling under the strain of a failing marriage. While Tony basks in his professional success and flirts with temptation, Elizabeth resigns herself to increasing bitterness. But their lives take an unexpected turn when Elizabeth meets her newest client, Miss Clara, and is challenged to establish a “war room” and a battle plan of prayer for her family. As Elizabeth tries to fight for her family, Tony’s hidden struggles come to light. Tony must decide if he will make amends to his family and prove Miss Clara’s wisdom that victories don’t come by accident.

Directed by Alex Kendrick and written by Alex Kendrick and Stephen Kendrick, WAR ROOM is produced by Stephen Kendrick, distributed by AFFIRM Films/Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in the general market, and Provident Distribution in the Christian retail market.
