The Kendrick brothers are now shifting into the production of Movie 5. Over the last five months we set up a production office, conducted online and live casting sessions, locked in our crew, and scouted the needed locations for the story. Every location is visually rich and completely fresh to us. God has provided an amazing cast of strong believers. Some are new faces to us, others you will recognize from our previous films, and there are a few surprises that many will recognize from the Christian ministry world. The Lord has also provided an excellent crew of Christian filmmakers and film-school interns. Many of them have been praying for God to open the door for them to work on a movie project that honors Him. Our production office is humming along. Lots of buzz. Tons of progress every day. We are very grateful that multiple pastors and churches are working together and surrounding this effort in prayer.

  


Filming will begin next week. We are asking for your prayer support as we enter into this crucial time. The production schedule is set for June and July this summer. The release of the movie title will come soon, but in the meantime, please pray! We need God’s continued blessing, favor, protection, and guidance to cover this entire process – down to the smallest detail. We know the enemy is at work to confuse, confound and attack, but God is clearly blessing and reigning over these efforts!

  


If you want to [sign up](http://eepurl.com/V-KSf) as a Prayer Warrior for Movie 5, you will receive periodic updates concerning specific ways to pray as production progresses.

Here’s a start…

  * Pray for God to be glorified throughout this entire process.
  * Pray that God anoints and uses this script to ignite believers and draw people to Christ.
  * Pray that Alex, Stephen, Shannon and their families will be surrounded by God’s strong hand of protection, provision, and peace throughout production and post-production.
  * Pray that God will do exceedingly above all we could ask or imagine for His glory through the finished product.
  * Pray for God to be glorified throughout this entire process.

  
Thank you so much for your ongoing prayer support! More to come…
