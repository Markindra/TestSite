The Marriage Evaluation examines seven categories of marital love and then identifies key verses of Scripture and specific days in The Love Dare to strategically help a couple strengthen their marriage relationship. Husbands and wives will be challenged to keep working, changing, forgiving, and loving. What better gift could you give your spouse than to love him/her more and to deepen your commitment to live according to Godâ€™s principles for marriage?

  
The new Parenting Evaluation examines six areas of parental love and effectiveness and then identifies specific Scriptures and days in The Love Dare for Parents book that can take your parenting to the next level. Understanding that strong parenting must be both responsive and proactive, this tool can help equip you to respond appropriately, wisely, and lovingly to each of your children as you daily nurture them to grow and thrive.

  
Both evaluations are fast and private and the results can be printed so you can keep working on specific areas. You can also re-take the evaluations whenever you like and track your progress. Try it out at [www.lovedaretest.com](http://www.lovedaretest.com/) and please share these tools with others.
